## 🌐 Upload to GitHub

### 1. Initialize Git Repository

```bash
cd "/home/tauya/Desktop/Project Final"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete weather monitoring system with ESP32 and Raspberry Pi"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `weather-monitoring-system`
3. Description: `Distributed IoT weather monitoring with ESP32 sensors, Raspberry Pi dashboard, and ML predictions`
4. Make it **Public** (for supervisor access)
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### 3. Connect and Push

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/weather-monitoring-system.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
